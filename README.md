## üöÄ About The Project

Minigame Studio is a fully functional front-end application that simulates a retro arcade experience in the browser. It features a main "cabinet" UI, a game selection menu, and three distinct, playable micro-games, each with its own soundtrack and scoring system.

The games included are:

- **Flappy Dot:** A challenging "Flappy Bird" clone with moving pipes and dynamic physics.
- **Dodge the Pixel:** A fast-paced avoider game with progressive difficulty and a neon aesthetic.
- **Color Catch:** A rhythm-based timing game with a combo multiplier, synced to a lofi beat.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Arcade Cabinet UI:** A fully styled, responsive retro arcade cabinet interface.
- **Three Unique Games:** Each with its own mechanics, visuals, and background music.
- **High Score System:** Scores are saved to `localStorage` for each game, so they persist between sessions.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Games like "Dodge the Pixel" and "Color Catch" get harder as your score increases.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with modern React principles, separating UI, state, and game logic into clean, reusable components.
- **Polished Visuals:** Features include custom fonts, CSS animations, scan line overlays, and a custom footer with social links.
